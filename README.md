# Minimum Operations

This directory contains Python code to solve the "Minimum Operations" problem.

## Problem Description

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, you need to write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

## File Structure

- `0-minoperations.py`: Contains the Python implementation of the method `minOperations(n)` which calculates the minimum number of operations required to reach the desired number of characters.
- `0-main.py`: Main file for testing the `minOperations` method with sample test cases.

## Usage

To test the implementation, run the `0-main.py` script:

```bash
$ python3 0-main.py
