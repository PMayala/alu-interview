# minOperations Function

## Overview

The `minOperations` function calculates the minimum number of operations needed to produce exactly `n` "H" characters in a file. The operations considered are:
1. **Copy All**: Copies all the characters currently in the file.
2. **Paste**: Pastes the characters copied last time.

This problem is commonly referred to in computational problems related to dynamic programming and optimization.
