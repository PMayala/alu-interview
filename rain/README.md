# Rainwater Trapping Algorithm

This repository contains a solution to the problem of calculating the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between walls of varying heights. The algorithm is implemented in Python.

## Problem Description

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

### Prototype
```python
def rain(walls)
